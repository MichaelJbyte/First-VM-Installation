# First VM Set-Up (Ubuntu Linux)

This will serve as documentation for my first installation of a hypervisor (VMWare Workstation Pro).
I will also document the setup process of Ubuntu Linux. 

## Hypervisor Install

* Created a Broadcom account and downloaded the latest version of VMWare Workstation Pro.
* Configured Workstation Pro 17 with the install wizard.

## Ubuntu Linux Install

* I chose to install the 64-bit version of Ubuntu 25.04.
* Opened up the virtual machine through VMware using the ISO file.

## Ubuntu Set-Up

After installing, I launched Ubuntu, completing the operating system download. 
- I also switched the virtual machine from booting off the ISO file to the physical drive.
