# First VM Set-Up

This will serve as documentation for my first installation of a hypervisor (VMWare Workstation Pro).
I will also document my installation process of Ubuntu Linux. 

- It is worth noting this is not my first time installing and setting up a VM. Simply my first time for a home lab.

## Virtual Machine Install

* Created a Broadcom account and downloaded the latest version of VMWare Workstation Pro.
* Configured Workstation Pro with the install wizard.

## Ubuntu Linux Install
* I chose to install the 32-bit version of Ubuntu 16.04.7 LTS.
* Installed the new virtual machine through VMWare Workstation and set to desired settings.
