# First VM Set-Up (Ubuntu Linux)

This will serve as documentation for my first installation of a hypervisor (VMWare Workstation Pro). 8/20/25

I will also document the setup process of Ubuntu Linux through a virtual machine. 

## Hypervisor Install

* Created a Broadcom account and downloaded the latest version of VMWare Workstation Pro.
* Configured Workstation Pro 17 with the install wizard.

## Ubuntu Linux Install

* I chose to install the 64-bit version of Ubuntu 25.04.
* Opened up the virtual machine through VMware using the ISO file.

## Ubuntu Set-Up

After installing, I launched Ubuntu, completing the operating system download. 
- I also switched the virtual machine from booting off the ISO file to the physical drive.

Once all downloads were finished for Ubuntu, I installed useful tools through the terminal.
- The tools I installed are the following: vim, ifconfig, nautilus, and gedit.

# Afterthoughts

This concludes my very first virtual machines setup which will aid my future homelab project and any other personal projects I may perform in the future. This process helped to familiarize me with the virtual machine installation procedure and select options you should choose when using virtual machines.
